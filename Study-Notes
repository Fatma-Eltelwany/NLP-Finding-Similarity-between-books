- What is a TF-IDF vector?
Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency. TF-IDF vector is a technique for text vectorization based on the Bag of words model 
with the addition of considering the importance of a given term in the text at hand.
A term is said to be importance (has a high importance score) when it occurs a lot in the given text and a little in other texts.
Hence, to get the TF-IDF of a term the TF score is multiplied by the IDF score.
TF-IDF scores are stored in the tfidf matrix
- Cosine Similarity:
It is a measure of how close (angle-wise) two vectors, in this context maps of two sentences for example, are.
It is computed by dividing the inner product (dot product) of the two vectors by the product of their lengths.
It ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values representing more similar vectors.
Similarity distance = 1 - cosine similarity
